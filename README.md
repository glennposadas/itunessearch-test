## Tech Stacks

The project was built using **Xcode 11.3**, **Swift 5.0**. 
Dependencies are managed by [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/).

**MVVM** is the architectural pattern used together with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) to maximize the utilization of the said pattern.

The important part of the project was **UI Tested**. And viewModels are **Unit Tested**, using the Apple's vanilla **XCTest** and **XCUITest** test frameworks.

**Moya** was used for additional networking layer. The project was made as if it will scale, hence the said library.

Lastly, to do the views layout, **SnapKit** was used. Personally, I write constraints faster with the said library compared to LayoutConstraints. *Long time ago, I was fond of ~~VFL.~~.*

# NON TECHNICAL PART
This part of the document contains instructions on how to build and run the project **iSearch**

## Getting Started

You'll need the following software installed on your mac machine.

1. Xcode - You can download it from the App Store on your mac.

---

## Downloading the source codes

Download the project is pretty straight forward. Find the GREEN button that says Clone Or Download, and you're good to go.

## Building the project

Build and running the project on to your simulator is easy. Make sure you are using `.xcworkspace` (white icon) and NOT `.xcodeproject` (blue icon). 
There's a difference between these two project files.

Now click on the **PLAY** button in your Xcode. Or simple press `CMD` + `R` to run the project on to your selected simulator or device. When running the project on to your real device, you will need to setup some certificates on your local machine.

## TestFlight

Inviting an internal user (a user under your Apple Developer Account) is quite not simple. I wrote before a wiki for this:
